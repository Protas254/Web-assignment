        <p>This project work focuses on hazardous aircraft weather forecasts in Kenya. The weather 
            parameters analyzed include fog, temperature and rain. 
            The main objectives of this field of study is to assess the impact of fog, temperature and rain on 
            aviation operation in Jomo Kenyatta Airport. This was achieved by determining the temporal 
            variation of both minimum and maximum temperature and also determining the relationship 
            between minimum temperature and fog days. </p>
